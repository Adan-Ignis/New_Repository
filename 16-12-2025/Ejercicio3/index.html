                We believe PDF tools<br>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>To provide the most comprehensive PDF toolbox that respects your privacy and never asks for payment.<br>We believe essential document tools should be accessible to everyone, everywhere, without barriers.</p>

            <p>OUR CORE PHILOSOPHY</p>
            <h2>Privacy First. Always.</h2>
            <p>In an era where data is a commodity, we take a different approach. All processing for Bentopdf tools happens locally in your browser. This means your files never touch our servers, we never see your documents, and we don't track what you do. Your documents remain completely and unequivocally private. It's not just a feature; it's our foundation.</p>

            <h2>Why Bentopdf?</h2>

        <h1>Welcome to the micro:bit developer community</h1>

        <h2>The micro:bit developer community site</h2>
        <p>
            This site aims to sit between a community wiki and a technical datasheet for the micro:bit. The content is available to edit on Github and is openly licensed through Creative Commons.<br>

            The site is maintained by the Micro:bit Educational Foundation in order to document the hardware and software that make the micro:bit work the way it does.<br>

            We hope to encourage contributions into these projects in order to broaden our ecosystem and the range of things people can invent with a micro:bit.<br>

            The Micro:bit Educational Foundation aims to be a ‘responsible downstream’ to the many open source software projects that are used to build the micro:bit: much like a good Linux distribution collates, tests, stabilises and releases combinations of many diverse open source packages, the micro:bit Educational Foundation and the micro:bit community present micro:bit users with a stable, tested release of all the things you need to make the magical ‘end-to-end’ micro:bit experience.<br>

        <h2>Help us build it</h2>
        If you’d like to help us make the micro:bit better, then there are a number of ways that you can get involved.

        <h2>Code</h2>
        <p>Contribute features and fixes to one of the upstream projects that the micro:bit relies upon:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The micro:bit Device Abstraction Layer (DAL/runtime)</li>
            <li>The MakeCode Editor</li>
            <li>The Python Editor</li>
            <li>DAPlink</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Build</h2>
        <p>Help us build a brilliant hardware ecosystem around micro:bit - derivative boards, cool accessories and add ons, or even suggestions for future versions of the micro:bit.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The micro:bit schematic and reference design are good places to start for making your own projects</li>
            <li>The accessories guide gives you an idea of what’s currently available.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Write</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve the documentation and this site, either reporting issues or adding documentation will be extremely helpful.</li>
            <li>Help build a community around micro:bit - join the slack channel and Email list, share the things you’ve created on twitter, blog about them!</li>
        </ul>
